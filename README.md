The fashion industry has evolved significantly with the 
growing demand for personalization and self-expression. 
In todayâ€™s globally connected world, customers seek unique 
ways to showcase their individuality rather than relying on 
mass-produced clothing. The advancement of internet 
technologies, digital design tools, and e-commerce platforms 
has made it easier than ever for individuals to create and 
purchase personalized apparel. Our web application was 
developed in response to this shift, offering users a creative 
space to design their own custom T-shirts. By allowing real
time design previews and seamless online ordering, our 
platform empowers users to transform their personal ideas into 
wearable fashion.This approach not only enhances customer 
satisfaction but also reflects the broader trend towards 
personalization and creativity in the modern fashion 
landscape. Through our platform, we aim to bridge technology 
and individuality, providing an engaging and accessible 
design experience for everyone
